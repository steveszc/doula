            <p>Every baby brought into this world is courageously born, no matter the circumstances of their arrival.</p>
            <blockquote>"There is a secret in our culture, and it's not that birth is painful.  It's that women are strong." - Laura Stavoe Harm</blockquote>
            <p>I am passionate about serving mothers and families as they welcome their little ones and grow their families. My doula services provide you with information, emotional support and comfort measures throughout pregnancy, birth and the postpartum year. I serve families delivering at any birth location in the Denver Metro area and I'm currently accepting due dates in May and beyond.</p>
            <p> I would love to sit down with you for a no-obligation meet and greet to answer your questions and discuss how I can support you as you prepare for your baby to be courageously born.</p>
