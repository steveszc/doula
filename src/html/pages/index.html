            <p>Every baby brought into this world is courageously born, no matter the circumstances of their arrival.</p>

            <h2>Birth Doula Services</h2>

            <p>I am a birth and postpartum doula certified through Doula Trainings International. I am passionate about supporting women and their families throughout pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum year.</p>

            <p>I believe every baby is born courageously, no matter the circumstances of their arrival. Whether you are experiencing pregnancy and birth for the first time or the tenth, it is an incredibly transformative time. Women deserve to be supported unconditionally as they courageously accept and navigate this transition. I provide support by normalizing the pregnancy and birth experience, offering educational resources, guiding the emotional journey and improving physical comfort through exercises, self-care and relaxation techniques.</p>

            <p>I serve families delivering at any birth location in the Denver Metro area and I'm currently accepting due dates. I would love to sit down with you for a no-obligation meet and greet to answer your questions and discuss how I can support you as you prepare for your baby to be courageously born.</p>

            <p>I live in south Denver with my husband, Steve, our young sons Adam, Ben, and Josh, and a lively border collie named Petey.
